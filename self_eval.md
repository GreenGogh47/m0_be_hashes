# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
> Syntax! But once I understood that accessing hash keys were different if it's a string vs a symbol, I worked way faster.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
> My strategy is to jot things down as they come, and as I'm studying on my own time, reformat my notes. That's where most of the learning happens for me.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
> I try to solve it on my own first, because then I get a better understanding of what to ask google.
